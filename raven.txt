Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost up on the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow

And the silky sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Filled me--thrilled me!--with fantastic terrors never felt before
