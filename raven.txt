Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost up on the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow

And the silky sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Filled me—thrilled me!—with fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
